Example for direct current stimulation
======================================

This example is based on the paper by Mobini et al. (dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.2821).

Run
---

Simply run

.. code::

	python3 study_mobini.py

The results will be stored in a directory named `results`.

Visualization
-------------

ParaView files to reproduce figureis in our EMBC contribution can be generated by opening ParaView 5.5 and choosing the .pvsm respective file in the `load state` dialog.
Note that you have to choose the files again as ParaView stores absolute paths.
You can use the filename as such, but have to navigate to the `results` directory that will be created during a successful run.
The line plots have been generated by gnuplot scripts (.gnu). The plotted .tsv files were previously exported from ParaView.
