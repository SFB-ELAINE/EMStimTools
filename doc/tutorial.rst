How to use EMStimTools
----------------------

Before giving an overview over the different parts of this package, you will find a brief tutorial on how to use the SALOME-GMSH-FEniCS workflow.


SALOME
======
SALOME is needed to create or at least process a CAD geometry and prepare the mesh.
If a MED-formatted mesh already exists, feel free to skip this part and start with the next section.
Currently, no other mesh format is supported.
Nevertheless, support for (g)msh files could be easily implemented.
